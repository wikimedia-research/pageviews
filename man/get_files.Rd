\title{retrieve a vector of sampled log files}
\usage{
get_files(earliest = NULL, latest = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{earliest}{a "Date" object. Set to NULL by default, which triggers
the retrieval of all log file names.}

\item{latest}{a "Date" object; set to NULL by default. In the event that
\code{earliest} is set but \code{latest} is not, the files retrieved
will span from \code{earliest} to the current date; in the event that
both arguments are set, the retrieved files will be those in that range.}
}
\value{
A vector of filenames that can be passed into \code{\link{read_sampled_log}}.
}
\description{
Grab sampled log files to be piped into
\code{\link{read_sampled_log}}. By default this retrieves all
sampled log files; it can be used to retrieve a particular date range of
files through the "earliest" and "latest" arguments.
